Neural network for predicting appliance energy consumption using keras

The motivation of this work is to test the machine learning library called keras. I used an open-source dataset [1,2] for the regression analysis using neural network.

Terminal usage:
```
$ python3 regression.py energydata.csv energytest.csv
```
